These are the second version of the OSD 2018 data, on which a slightly more extended QC has been performed on the digitised logsheeets: where stations returned values in units that were not as requested in the SOPs and the OSD Handbook, if it was possible a conversion to the requested unit was carried out, and if not the value was discarded. An indicator of the type of conversion done is contained in a flag column in the data spreadsheet with more information provided in the metadata spreadsheet, and details of the conversions are provided as an additional document.

- CSV files with the collected environmental, event, and omics data (being [ENA accession numbers](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home)) - where data flags were added to mitigate confusion about the units, and character malformations were corrected:
  - [OSD18Data_version2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocean-sampling-day/OSD2018/main/QualityControlledData/version2/OSD18Data_version2.csv)
- CSV files with the metadata to accompany these data files:
  - [OSD18Metadata_HumanReadable_version2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocean-sampling-day/OSD2018/main/QualityControlledData/version2/OSD18Metadata_HumanReadable_version2.csv) to accompany the equivalently-named Data file
  - [OSD18Metadata_MachineReadable_version2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocean-sampling-day/OSD2018/main/QualityControlledData/version2/OSD18Metadata_MachineReadable_version2.csv), to accompany the equivalently-named Data file
- A turtle file with the collected environmental, event and omics data described in RDF triples: [OSD18Data_version2.ttl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocean-sampling-day/OSD2018/main/QualityControlledData/version2/OSD18Data_version2.ttl).
