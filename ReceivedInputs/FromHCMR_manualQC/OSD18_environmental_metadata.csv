The two possible values given are not equivalent to each other, hence unless a unit is specifically given, we cannot publish this value. According to Jonas: “I don't think so, usually sensors give an output in volts if that value still needs to be converted (via certain algorithm or certain piece of processing for example). Specifically, the VPR also measures everything in volts that is subsequently converted to chl, turbidity, etc. Will be the same here.
In other words: in this case it seems to me that part of the data has already been converted from volts to mg/L (via a piece of processing unknown to us). But not everything.”"

While two units were allowed, and they measure in a different way, the units are equivlant. Not all stations give their units, so in our published data we will use NTU (which is slightly more popular in these data) but we will need to add a flag for those that are in FTU as this indicates a different measuring method. Note: the entires in FNU are valid units, and appear to be also equivalent to FTU and NTU"
